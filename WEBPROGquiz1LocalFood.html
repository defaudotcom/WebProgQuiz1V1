                                <p>
                                    Soto Betawi is a typical Jakartan soup with a rich, creamy broth. It's cooked with beef (typically a combination of flesh, 
                                    tripe, and offal), coconut milk, and an aromatic spice blend that includes lemongrass, galangal, and candlenut. 
                                    The soup is often served with rice and garnished with fried shallots, lime leaves, and, for added heat, 
                                    sambal (chilli paste). Soto Betawi is a soothing and hearty dish that reflects the unique flavours of Jakarta and is 
                                    enjoyed by both locals and visitors.<br>

                                <h2>Kerak Telor</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Kerak Telor is a traditional Betawi snack that you should have if you visit Jakarta. 
                                    It's a savoury glutinous rice cake prepared with duck or chicken eggs. 
                                    Before cooking on a charcoal barbecue, the ingredients are combined with spices, 
                                    shredded coconut, and fried shallots. Kerak Telor is distinguished by its somewhat crispy, 
                                    crusty texture on the outside, while the inside stays soft and tasty. 
                                    It's typically served on a banana leaf and is popular at festivals or as street food in Jakarta.
                                     Kerak Telor is a wonderful and unusual Jakarta snack due to its combination of textures and flavours.<br>
